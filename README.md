# dogs2-redux

* This is a complete re factor of the original dogs2 project, it still uses a React.js front end, but the backend is now Express.js, with a prisma ORM connected to a MySQL server.

## Tools needed
* Node.js
* a SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite
* IDE, I perfer either VSCode or IntelliJ but any will do,

## Getting Started

### Backend
* First you will need to install the dependencies, do this with the command:
`npm i` or `npm install`
